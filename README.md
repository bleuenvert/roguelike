# I am following a tutorial on building a roguelike game

## Add a link to the tutorial
## This is for the purpose of learning python
## I do intended to expand on this project further afterwards
## Kind of want to turn it into a bad funny philosophy game
## like maybe you play as different philosophers and each have their own quest
## like Plato fighting featherless birds and sophists?
